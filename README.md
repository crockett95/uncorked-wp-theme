## Description
Built with _s and Twitter's Bootstrap, Uncorked is a fully-responsive, flexible-width theme for Wordpress. Built with LESS, it is extremely modular and easy to customize from the back-end. Using template parts for a very modular, interchangeable design, I built this theme for myself to easily customize into custom sites for design clients looking for something unique. **This theme utilizes HTML5 and CSS3, and currently may not be fully compatible with all browsers.**

As this is my first theme, it's still fairly rough around the edges, but I have large ambitions for features, integration and functionality, and continuous updates and improvements will be forthcoming.
