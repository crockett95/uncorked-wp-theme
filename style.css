Description: Built with _s and Twitter's Bootstrap, Uncorked is a fully-responsive, flexible-width theme for Wordpress. Built with LESS, it is extremely modular and easy to customize from the back-end. Using template parts for a very modular, interchangeable design, I built this theme for myself to easily customize into custom sites for design clients looking for something unique.
